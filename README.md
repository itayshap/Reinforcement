# RL FINAL PROJECT
 
All the cells in the notebook can be executed.
full notebook Running time ~ 18 hours
## Notebook Structure:
 - Packages Installations
 - Models weights and explainer.md upload
 - Packages Imports
 - Display utils - function for creating videos
 - Utils - custom environment wrapper, plotting functions, etc.
 - Models utils â€“ functions to create the maze environment

### EX1 - FIX SCENARIO - PUSH & PULL - ONE BOX:

 - **Using DDQN**
	 - Training the model
	 - Success rate, Rewards, and Steps graph
	 - Half-way video
	 - Training completed video

 -  **EX1 - Experiments**
	 - Experiment 1 - Rewards Shaping VS No Rewards Shaping
	 - Experiment 2 - DDQN VS PPO

### EX2 - PUSH & PULL - ONE BOX:
 

 - Video - feeling the environment 

 - **EX2 - Experiments - DDQN:**

	 - Experiment 1 - Different Environment max_steps
	 - Experiment 2 - Different Reward Shaping
	 - Experiment 3 - Different Net Architectures
	 - Experiment 4 - Different batch_size and memory buffer size
	 - Experiment 5 - Transfer Learning
	 - Experiment 6 - Network Update frequency
	 - Experiment 7 - Different Environment Action Spaces

 -  **EX2 - Experiments - PPO:**

	 - Experiment 1 - PPO - Hyper-parameters Grid Search
	 - Experiment 2 - PPO - Max steps
	 - Experiment 3 - PPO - Action space
	 - Experiment 4 - PPO - Different net architectures

 - Final experiment - DQN vs PPO - DDQN vs PPO
